## Committed to ethical tech 🍀

I started my career in social sciences as a cognitive psychologist. After learning about the human brain, I decided to learn about the machine brain. My primary commitment in the tech world is to ideate, develop, create, and involve myself in ethical tech. It must be open, honest, and transparent. It must be resourced ethically and fairly. It must be environment-first and human-oriented. No big, empty talk about tech giants and billionaires. No supporting wars, colonisations, and all kinds of power-imbalanced offences. 

## What I like ❤️

<p align="center">Cosy chats, parallel play, silent book club</p>
<p align="center">Having balanced quality me-time and quality social-time</p>
<p align="center">Perfect-temperature tea</p>
<p align="center">Pixel art</p>
<p align="center">Obsessed with: Stardew Valley</p>

## Hire me❔

I am currently following an intensive 7-month AI and Data Science bootcamp by [BeCode](https://becode.org/). All projects created during the bootcamp can be found in my repositories. I am aspiring to work in a small-to-medium-sized company. The roles I can do well:  
  
:electron: Data scientist  
:electron: End-to-end data analyst  
:electron: Data-related project management  
:electron: Data engineer (if that's the official title in your company)  
:electron: Python developer  
:electron: Personality hire (a joke, but I also won't get offended. Just know that I'm an introvert.)  

## Call me, maybe 📲

If you want to collaborate with me, offer me a job opportunity, or hire me: Send me an [email](mailto:65pg7f60e\@mozmail.com) and, if you want, ask for my mobile number. Communicating via emails is certainly good, but I will not hesitate to talk on the phone. Please give me a headsup before you call, so I know if I should pick up. I speak fluent English (unless my brain stops braining) and medium-rare East Flemish (i.e., Dutch).
